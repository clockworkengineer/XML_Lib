      	<!-- The Condition attribute specifies whether the property can currently be 
	     presented to a customer, or at least how it appears at the moment.
	     The possible conditions are:
		* Excellent: This suggests that the property has little to no flaw
		* Good: This means that the property is mostly acceptable and can be 
		  presented to a potential buyer. In this case, something such as a 
		  refrigerator or a dishwasher may be missing; or something such as
		  the garbage dispenser may need to be fixed, or a piece of carpet 
		  that needs to be cleaned before the property is actually ready for sale
		* Needs Repair: This means that the property is in a good selling condition.

    	<!-- A property can be located by its address which
	     in most cases is made of an address, a city, a state (US, DE, AU, NG, etc) or

    	<!-- To make it easy to locally find a property, the location may not be an actual
	     city and usually people out of town may have a hard time finding it on a map.

	     estate properties would be familiar with the place.

	<!-- In our real estate listing, there are two types of bathrooms, full and half:
		* A bathroom is counted as full if it is equipped with either a shower area,

		* A bathroom is considered half if it (typically) has neither a shower area 
		  nor a bath tub. In most single family and townhouses, a half bath
		  is constructed on the floor level to conveniently serve the visitors who 
		  enter the house. A typical half bathroom has a toilet (to do the business) 
		  and a sink to wash the hands.
