# XML_Lib
Parse XML into an internal XML Object (generating an exception
if it is found not to be syntactically correct "well formed") so that it can
be manipulated, interrogated and saved back to a text form (stringify). For more
information on the XML standard check out https://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/. 

At present it does no contain any mechanism for conversion from XML to other 
formats as it is deemed to generic and would have to be in a fixed non standardsied 
format for conversion (ie. lists, dictionaries).
