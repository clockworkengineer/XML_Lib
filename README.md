# XML_Lib
Parse XML into an internal XML Object (generating an exception
if it is found not to be syntactically correct "well formed") so that it can
be manipulated, interrogated and saved back to a text form (stringify). For more
information on the XML standard check out https://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/.
