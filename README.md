# XML_Lib

Welcome to **XML_Lib**, a C++ library designed for working with XML documents. This library is developed using **C++20** and is meant to provide efficient, reliable, and easy-to-use tools for processing, reading, and writing XML data.

---

## Features

- **XML Parsing**: Parse XML strings or files effortlessly with error handling and validation.
- **XML Generation**: Create well-structured XML documents with minimal effort.
- **Object-Oriented APIs**: Intuitive and developer-friendly interfaces to handle XML elements, attributes, and nodes.
- **Namespace Support**: Work with XML namespaces for better compatibility with XML standards.
- **Performance-Oriented**: Built with a focus on speed and memory efficiency.
- **Cross-Platform**: Fully compatible with Linux and other C++20-compliant environments.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To build and use this library, ensure your system meets the following requirements:

1. A C++20-compliant compiler (e.g., GCC 10+, Clang 10+, MSVC 19.29+).
2. [CMake](https://cmake.org/) (version 3.20 or later).

### Build Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
```shell script
git clone <repository_url>
   cd XML_Lib
```

2. Create a build directory and configure the project:
```shell script
mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
```

3. Compile the source code:
```shell script
make
```

4. Optionally, you can run tests (if provided):
```shell script
ctest
```

## Basic Usage

Include `XML_Lib` in your C++ project to perform XML operations. Add the library as a dependency to your project by linking it in your `CMakeLists.txt`:

```cmake
find_package(XML_Lib REQUIRED)
target_link_libraries(your_project_name PRIVATE XML_Lib)
```

### Example Code

Here's a simple example of how you might use `XML_Lib` to parse and manipulate XML:

```c++
#include <xml_lib/xml_helper.hpp> // Update with the actual header once available

int main() {
    // Example XML string or file
    std::string xml = R"(<root><child name="value"/></root>)";
    
    // Parse XML
    auto document = XML_Lib::parse(xml);

    // Manipulate data
    auto root = document.getRoot();
    auto child = root.getChild("child");
    std::cout << "Child name: " << child.getAttribute("name") << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```
